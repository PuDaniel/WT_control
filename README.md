# WT Control

A Toolbox to help control different aspects of the 7x5ft WT at the University of Bristol

Currently this toolbox only includes code to control the vertical gust vanes.

### Installation

Once you have cloned this repository run the `addsandbox.m` file to add the relevent paths to your MATLAB path.
This must be done each time you open MATLAB (considering adding it to your `startup.m` file to automate this process)

To remove the paths from your MTALB path run `rmsandbox.m`


### Gust Vane Control

please see the demo script in the example folder for the code to control the gust vanes
